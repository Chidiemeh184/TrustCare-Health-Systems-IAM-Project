# TrustCare Health Systems - Project Setup

---
### üõ†Ô∏è Overview 

This project can be setup using any virtual machine of your choice. I have a latest Mac Studio with Apple silicon m2 chip but due to this not 
being able to run the latest VirtualBox, I had to fall back to using my older silicon mac mini. 

On my mac mini due to resource constraints I only created the minimum virtual machines needed to simulate the late and achieve the AD requirements 
for TrustCare. For example: A minimum of 14 domain controllers was needed for all regions across US, with 3 DC for the HQ in Atlanta for load balancing and redundancy. I created 3 DCs for Atlanta, howevery just one for the rest of the regions. In a real-world environment where resources are available this would not be the case. Perhaps at least 2 DCs for each regions to accomodate resource needs.


Here are the details of VirtualBox I Used and my Mac Mini configurations-
