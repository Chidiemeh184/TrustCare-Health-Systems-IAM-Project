# TrustCare Health Systems - Project Setup

---
## üõ†Ô∏è Overview

This project can be set up using any virtual machine of your choice. I have a latest Mac Studio with Apple Silicon M2 chip, but due to this not being able to run the latest VirtualBox, I had to fall back to using my older Intel Mac Mini.

On my Mac Mini, due to resource constraints, I only created the minimum virtual machines needed to simulate the lab and achieve the AD requirements for TrustCare. For example: A minimum of 14 domain controllers was needed for all regions across the US, with 3 DCs for the HQ in Atlanta for load balancing and redundancy. I created 3 DCs for Atlanta; however, just one for the rest of the regions. In a real-world environment where resources are available, this would not be the case. Perhaps at least 2 DCs for each region to accommodate resource needs.

Here are the details of VirtualBox I used and my Mac Mini configurations:

### VirtualBox
**Version:** 7.0  
**Build:** 7.0.14 r161096 (Qt5.15.2)  
**Year:** 2024

**Graphics:** Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB
