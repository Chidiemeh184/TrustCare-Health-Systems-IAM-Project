This is a Job Posting for Junior IAM position. For the last week I have been able to build my foundation on IAM using TrustCare project. Look At the job responsibilities for Xtensys. Using the TrustCare scenario, create me a project task that meets all the job responsibilities. You can make up 5 or more task to perform for each responsibility. On a separate study I want to take these and run a lab scenario this weekend and gain real work experience applicable to this job. Make as much tasks as possible. Don't stop at Junior, create Mid and Senior tasks as extra challenges. Be rigorous

## Implementation Plan

To make the most of your weekend lab scenario:

1. **Start with Junior Tasks**: Begin with core user and group management tasks to establish your foundation
2. **Progress to Mid-Level**: Move to more complex configurations like MFA and security policy implementation
3. **Document Everything**: Create proper documentation for all tasks as you would in a real work environment
4. **Challenge Yourself**: Attempt at least one senior level task to stretch your skills
5. **Create a Portfolio**: Compile your work into a portfolio that demonstrates your capabilities for the interview

This comprehensive set of tasks will provide you with hands-on experience that directly aligns with the requirements in the Xtensys job description, using the TrustCare scenario as your real-world context.
